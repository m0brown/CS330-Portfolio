# Module 8 Journal

### How do I approach designing software?
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

- What design process did you follow for your project work?

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?


While this project is not the best showcase of my cumulative skills while pursuing my degree, I am proud of how much I have learned this term. I knew this would be a challenging class coming into it, and now I can say from my experience that it is. When designing my code, I like to understand and plan out what I want to accomplish and then apply the principles of object-oriented programming to help me during the development process. I feel like I could have done a better job with that during this project, but I ran out of time, so I had to submit one long file. By the end, I wanted the program to at least work with the required functionality, so I had to forgo my usual process. I am happy that I learned a new skill and relatively satisfied with the look of my final scene, so I think I will take the wins I can get this term.

       
### How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- How did iteration factor into your development?
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

During this term, I followed along with the tutorials to try and learn the process and how everything worked together. I then would try and apply the new material to my project. This process was beneficial to learning each new concept since repetition helped me to understand the components that make up the final scene. I kept this method for the entire term, and it didn't change much until week 6 when I had lots of issues with my lighting. Re-doing my entire code was a frustrating task, but I'm glad I did it instead of banging my head and trying to figure out what I was doing wrong with my initial code.


### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

This class proves to me that I can learn new concepts in computer science and that I should never think that I can't. I'm getting close to finishing my degree and feel confident that I will be able to now that I have made it through this class. The confidence this class has given me can also be applied to my professional pursuits. In a real work environment, you're expected to have goals and grow your skillset. Returning to school later was a big step for me, but this class made me proud of my accomplishments and solidified that I can learn new skills and never think that I can't.
